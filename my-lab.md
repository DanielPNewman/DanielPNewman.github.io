I am a member of [Prof. Mark Bellgrove’s][1] group at the School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University. I mostly work from our EEG/eye-tracking lab, though we also have a fully equipped human molecular genetics lab. We perform our MRI acquisition at [Monash Biomedical Imaging (MBI)][2]. My research involves strong collaborative ties with [Dr Redmond O’Connell][3] from the Trinity College Institute of Neuroscience and [Dr Ger Loughnane][4]  from the Trinity Centre for Bioengineering.

I am always looking for willing volunteers to participate in my experiments, if you are interested in this please [contact me!][5]

My PhD supervisors are [Prof. Mark Bellgrove][1] (Monash University) and [Dr Redmond O’Connell ][3](Trinity College Dublin)
