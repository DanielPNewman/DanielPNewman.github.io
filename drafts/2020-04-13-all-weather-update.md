Eight months ago in Aug 2019 my wife [Amy][1] and I published a blog post called [Global “all-weather” portfolios - investment adventures of an Aussie couple][3] sharing our research into a stratagy to reduce investment timing risk. We are very glad that we did this research and took action based on our findings because it has served us very well since. 

A number of people have asked how this strategy has fared so far in response to the covid19 epidemic. So rather than replying to each person individually, Amy and I decided that **1)** I'd write this quick post here, with plots including updated date showing the portfolios we described in our [original blog post][3] have fared since we published it; and 2) Amy would write a quick post on her website showing [our evolved solution executing an Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) filtered version of this stratagy][### link to Amy's new blog post] as a single global ESG portfolio.   

So below are updated version of the plots from our [original blog post][3] - with the new performance data added from the 8 months since we published it. 

## Domestic Australian assets - performance updates:

#### The original domestic Australian asset mix since we published it in Aug 2019
![]({{"/images/AU-newDataOnly.png"|absolute_url}})
**Figure 1**. *The domestic Australian “All-Seasons” and “Our Version” portfolios have had superior returns and smaller drawdowns compared to 100% equities via the ASX 300 acummulation index, since we [pulished the asset mix in Aug 2019][3]. The relevant securities and weights for each of these portfolios are shown in in Table 2 of our [original blog post][3].*

#### Historical performance of the original domestic Australian asset mix 
![]({{"/images/AU-combo-updated.png"|absolute_url}})
**Figure 2**. *Historical performance simulations of domestic Australian “All-Seasons” and “Our Version” portfolios show these portfolios had considerably smaller and less frequent drawdowns compared to 100% equities via the ASX 300 acummulation index. The overall return of 100% equities (ASX 300) was the highest, however one could have put money in/taken it out of All-Seasons and Our Version at any time since 2001 without suffering unpalatable losses. The same can not be said for ASX 300 which, on five occasions since 2001 has suffered drawdowns large enough to be unacceptable for our situation. The relevant securities and weights for each of these portfolios are shown in Table 2 of our [original blog post][3]. ETFs for the required asset classes were not available prior to 2012 so the pre-2012 performance shown is based on their underlying indexes. Historical bond performance was derived from futures price indices with coupon payments accumulated semi annually at historical 10 year yield rates. The commodities performance reflects underlying SPGCLEP commodities index only, excluding potential ETF distribution payments and currency hedging effects. We painstakingly sourced this historic index data from a variety of free sources and can't guarantee its accuracy - if anybody reading this has access to a proprietary data source they’d like to share with us, please get in touch!* <br>
<sub> Note these simulated results do not include brokerage fees and assumes the desired portfolio balance is maintained throughout, whereas in practice, the portfolio would be rebalanced periodically (e.g. every 6 months or so). Simulated historical performance results have inherent limitations since unlike an actual performance record, simulations do not reflect the cost of trading or the impact of actual trades on market factors such as volume and liquidity. <sub>

## Foreign Assets - performance updates:

<a name="figure-3-link"></a>
#### The original foreign asset mix since we published it in Aug 2019
![]({{"/images/Global-newDataOnly.png"|absolute_url}})
**Figure 3.** *Our Versions of the unleveraged foreign asset mix have had superior returns also smaller and less frequent drawdowns compared to 100% “Global Equities”. The relevant securities and weights for each of the portfolios depicted here are provided in Table 2 of our [original blog post][3].*<br>

#### Historical performance of the original foreign asset mix
![]({{"/images/Global-combo-updated.png"|absolute_url}})
**Figure 4.** *Historical performance simulations of “Our Version” of an unleveraged global All-Weather portfolio show it had lower returns over time but also considerably smaller and less frequent drawdowns compared to 100% “Global Equities”. Again, 100% global equities gives a higher overall return, but our current time-horizon and needs favour limiting drawdowns over maximising returns. The relevant securities and weights for each of the portfolios depicted here are provided in Table 2 of our [original blog post][3].*<br>

See the Q and A section below for commentary on periodic rebalancing.<sub>

**An important point to reiterate is that the portfolios here are NOT the same as Bridgewater’s All-Weather.** Bridgewater uses cheap [leverage][16] and sophisticated investment instruments to increase returns while still minimizing risk. These simplified portfolios we show here do not use leverage and thus has **lower expected returns than Bridgewater's All-Weather, but still reduces risk compared to 100% equities.** 

## Our continued evolution

We wanted a single globally diversified portfolio filtered for [ESG][4]/ethical considerations and based upon the all-weather principles discussed here and in our [original blog post][3]... So now we share [our evolved solution, executing a superior ESG filtered version of this stratagy!][###link]. 

*Looking forward, we're still making good progress on figuring out how to cost-effectively leverage our lower volatility asset classes (e.g. the Treasury bonds) to have similar expected volatility/returns as equities, thus maintaining risk parity while increasing returns, like Bridgewater can. We still need to iron out some more of the details around margin requirements, transaction costs and rebalancing, etc. but it is looking very promising. So stay tuned for the instalment!*
