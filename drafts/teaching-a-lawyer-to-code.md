title: Teaching a Lawyer to code? An Lawyer learning programming for data analysis/communication
author: Daniel Newman
description: Teaching a lawyer programming for data analysis and visualisation
---

[Amy][7] works as a Lawyer and environmental sustainability consultant, and wanted to know some programming for data analysis/communicaiton to help uncover and share useful environmental sustainability insights. I work as a Data Scientist so taught her some of my trade's tools to help set up [her own github account][14] and then learn the `R`, `Git` and `*nix` commands nessary for her to:

1. pull environmental data from a google sheets URL, 
2. process it,
3. visualise it, 
3. knit the results to `markdown` format
4. and publish the results on her [own github pages blog][15].  

This was a satisifying and educational process for us both: 

- Amy learnt the data processing/visualisation skills needed to uncover and communicate environmental sustainability insights (more on those below). 

- I learnt about some facinating ideas about how Project Drawdownâ€™s solutions apply to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

And it lead to publishing an excellent and thought provoking post: [Project Drawdown solutions meet many Sustainable Development Goals][16]. Certainly worth a read!
