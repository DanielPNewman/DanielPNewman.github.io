
Amy and I posted a number of blogs since our [August 2019 post][2] outlining a defensive portfolio to weather economic storms. The follow-up posts in April 2020, after the market shocks caused by COVID 19, showed that both the [original solution][3] and our evolved solution executing an [Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) filtered version][4] of this strategy performed exactly as designed and weathered the COVID 19 market storms very well, for which we were very happy and grateful. 

But now that bond yields across developed economies are so close to zero, there is minimal upside left in holding the large amounts of nominal bonds outlined in our previous blogs. Coupled with the ongoing extreme amounts of money printing by central banks, these circumstances made us wonder if there isn’t a better asset class, than nominal bonds, to use to diversify against downturns in equities while also protecting against inflation risk<sup>1</sup>.

I investigated replacing some (or all) of the nominal bonds with Inflation Linked (IL) bonds in our asset mix, while still holding a balanced mix diversified across currencies, geographies and asset classes.

My analysis found that the simplest way to deal with this was to keep our equities, commodities, gold and emerging markets target % weights as they are, and simply switch my government bonds to Inflation Linked (IL) government bonds instead. I thought of this after watching the last few mins from around 27:45 onwards of [this video from Bridgewater][5]. The whole video is excellent, but the last few mins lay out my reasons succinctly.

When I ran historic data through my volatility budgeting algorithm to figure out the new weights I'd need if I was going to do this and still keep it 'balanced' in line with the all-weather principle, interestingly the weights come out neatly such that all that is required to make this tactical change, is to sell my government bonds, and switch them all to IL bonds, all the other assets' weights stay basically as they were.

The resulting asset mix looks very much like that in [Table 1](#table-1-link).

<sup>1</sup>Previously, when equity markets have dropped, central banks have lowered interest rates to stimulate their economies, thus driving up bond prices which have counterbalanced the short-term downturn in equities to smooth out the ride in our balanced portfolio. But now that interest rates are basically at 0%, the stimulative lever of lowering interest rates is no longer going to be effective to offset drops in equity markets. So, what do we expect countries to do next time equity markets drop? For one thing, monetary policy is likely to get more extreme in terms of printing money. This extreme increase in money printing brings another risk for anybody holding large % of nominal bonds – inflation. Since bonds hold a promise to pay back their face value in cash, high inflation rates erode the purchasing power of cash and thus decrease the value of nominal bonds.
