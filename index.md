Below is a little personal info, and my blog can be found in the menu (top left corner).

I am interested in data, the human brain, psychology, financial markets, economics and general data science methods. I enjoy understanding problems and opportunities, hypothesis formation and testing, feature engineering & using predictive modelling to help craft innovative solutions.

I currently work as a Data Scientist, using modelling and machine learning to create efficiencies and business value. 

Before that, I completed a PhD in cognitive neuroscience at Monash University, Australia. I completed my undergraduate and honours degree at University of Queensland. Check out [some of my cognitive neuroscience research] [1].
