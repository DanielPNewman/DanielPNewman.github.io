Below is a little personal info, and my blog is found in the menu (top left).

I am interested in data science, the human brain, markets, economics, investing, human behaviour, psychology and sustainability. I love focusing on understanding problems and opportunities with large impact and scale, hypothesis formation and testing, modelling and engineering to craft solutions that help people and increase efficiency. 

I work as a Data Scientist, using machine learning to create efficiencies that help people and organisations succeed.

Before my data science career, I completed a [PhD in cognitive neuroscience][1].

I am currently on a 12 month sabbatical vagabonding around Asia with my wife [Amy][2]:
