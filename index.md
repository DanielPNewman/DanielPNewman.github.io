Hello! You’ve reached Daniel P. Newman’s personal website, my blog can be found on the side menu, and here is a little personal info:

I am interested in the human brain, human psychology, financial markets, economics and general data science.

I recently completed a PhD in cognitive neuroscience at Monash University, Australia. Before that, I completed my undergraduate and honours degree at University of Queensland. Check out [some of my cognitive neuroscience research] [1]. 

Nowadays I’m doing some cognitive neuroscience research - I work part-time as a researcher for the Bellgrove Laboratory as Monash University School of Psychological Sciences – but I’ve also expanded my interests to include both the financial markets, and data science more generally. I’m studying in my spare time to sit the [Level I CFA exam] [2], and I also do some work on a casual basis as a data scientist for [Vokke’s Business Intelligence team] [3]. 

I frequently use the [Matlab] [4] and [R] [5] languages for data analysis, and I've recently started to play around learning [Python] [6] for data science too (I plan to write a blog post about triumphs and pitfalls along a journey transitioning to Python from R, when I get some time!). I sill remember my way around [SPSS] [7] fairly well too, but I rarely using SPSS for data analysis these days.     

This is me at one of my favourite places in Australia, Tidal River at Wilsons Promontory National Park:
