title: Teaching a Lawyer to code? A Lawyer learns programming for data analysis/communication

description: Teaching a lawyer programming for data analysis and visualisation
---

[Amy][7] works as a Lawyer and environmental sustainability consultant. She wanted to now some programming for data analysis/communicaiton to help uncover and share useful environmental sustainability insights. I work as a Data Scientist so taught her some of my trade's tools to help set up [her own github account][14] and then learn the `R`, `Git` and `*nix` commands nessary for her to:

1. pull environmental data from a google sheets URL, 
2. process it,
3. visualise it, 
3. knit the results to `markdown` format
4. and publish the results on her [own github pages blog][15].  

This was a satisifying and educational process for us both: 

- Amy learnt the data processing/visualisation skills needed to uncover and communicate environmental sustainability insights (more on those below). 

- I learnt about some facinating ideas about how Project Drawdownâ€™s solutions apply to the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

And it led to publishing an excellent and thought provoking post: [Project Drawdown solutions meet many Sustainable Development Goals][16]. Certainly worth a read!

On reflection, I encourage data scientist to teach others some of the basic tools of our trade. Because this empowers others with new tools to explore and communicate data through the multiple lenses of many diverse areas of domain expertiease. 

Amy said that "for me, programing for data analysis and online communication is such an unknown area that it's hard to know where to start. So to have somebody who can walk you through some of the basics to get you started is really empowering!"
