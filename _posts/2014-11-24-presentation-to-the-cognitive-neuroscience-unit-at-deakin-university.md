This is my first blog post, and it is actually going to be a shout out to somebody else’s blog! A couple of weeks ago I went over to Deakin University and gave a short presentation to the Cognitive Neuroscience Unit (CNU) at Deakin. I presented some of the work we have been doing in our lab at Monash. The CNU blogged about my talk here:

<a title="Spatial attention asymmetries in disorders of attention" href="http://cogexneuro.blogspot.com.au/2014/11/spatial-attention-asymmetries-in.html" target="_blank">http://cogexneuro.blogspot.com.au/2014/11/spatial-attention-asymmetries-in.html</a>

It was great to meet the members of the newly formed Deakin CNU, they have attracted an excellent team of researchers there lead by <a title="Peter Enticott" href="http://www.deakin.edu.au/profiles/peter-enticott" target="_blank">Peter Enticott</a>. I was impressed by the enthusiasm for cognitive neuroscience shown by the members of the CNU. After the talk I was shown a tour around the labs at the Deakin CNU, and I was very impressed with their facilities for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcranial_magnetic_stimulation" target="_blank">transcranial magnetic stimulation</a> (TMS).  I believe the CNU was only established this year (2014), but have already been productive and I’m expecting to see more exciting research from them in the years to come!
