> **Lower risk comes with lower expected returns**<br>*We’re not suggesting our simple All-Weather portfolio is optimal or will maximize returns. It almost certainly won’t. Rather, it is designed to protect assets by avoiding large drawdowns during economic upheavals and market downturns, while still providing reasonable returns above the cash interest rate. In our current circumstance the security of knowing we are less exposed to downturns is worth the decreased expected return potential.*

> **Note on long-term treasuries in Australia:**<br>*Of note is that we could not find any ETFs on the ASX that tracked long term (~20-25 years) Australian treasury bonds. We found only individual exchange traded long-term treasury bonds (ETBs). These ETBs have lower liquidity than the ETFs which can make it difficult to buy and sell when desired. Because of this we considered not using long-term bonds at all. But since Dalio recommended including long-term bonds because they provide higher returns than intermediate (due to higher volatility), we decided to give the ETBs a go. Increased bond volatility and returns was particularly important to us since we have not yet figured out how to leverage up the volatility and returns of our bond holdings in a cost effective way.*

It’s worth noting that BetaShares Australian Sustainability Leaders ETF (FAIR) provides an ethical/sustainable Aussie equities option, and Vanguard Ethically Conscious International Shares Index ETF (VESG) provides an ethical/sustainable Global equities option, we found these really interesting.*
