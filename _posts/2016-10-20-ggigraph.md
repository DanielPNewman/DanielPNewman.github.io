###In my last blog (see below) I had just discovered the plotly package and was blown away by how easy it was to use plotly to make ggplot2 plots reactive to the user’s mouse. 
Well I’ve just stumbled across another package to achieve this called [ggiraph][1] which I like even more!!  
In my opinion [ggiraph][1] integrates with ggolot2 in a nicer way than plotly for making the plot reactive to the user’s mouse. 
Below is some code to make same fake data as I used in my last blog post, but this time I use [ggiraph][1] to turn the static ggplot2 plot from my last blog post into a plot with user reactivity.  
The code below uses functions from the "ggplot2", "stringr",  "dplyr", "knitr" and "[ggiraph][1]" packages.
