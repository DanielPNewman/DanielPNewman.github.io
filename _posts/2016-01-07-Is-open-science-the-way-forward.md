I’ll be finishing up my PhD over the next two months, exciting times! Since I’ve got a thesis to write, I’ll try to keep this post short (or maybe long, but written in a hurry!). I have to give another shout out to the [The Peer Reviewers Openness Initiative (PRO)] [1] which is one of a number of excellent new initiatives in support of open science, and which has already received over [200 signatories] [2].
Basically [PRO] [1] outlines a mechanism whereby peer reviewers require access to data/analysis code/materials (or at least a reason from the authors why these things are not provided) before conducting a comprehensive review. This is designed to shift incentives and achieve the goal of creating the expectation of open science practices. The advantages that will come with mass uptake of open science practices, particularly in relationship to the PRO initiative have been recently been outlined in excellent blogs by researchers who are more accomplished and qualified than me (e.g. see [here] [3] , [here] [4] , [here] [5] , [here] [6] , [here] [7] and [here] [8] ). So this post is not about rehashing their excellent points. Rather, I wish to add another perspective to this discussion, from the viewpoint of a very early career researcher.  

Since I am currently considering post-PhD career paths (e.g. post-doc positions, industry positions), initiatives like [PRO] [1] are important to me as they give me hope that over time the incentives in academic science will change to encourage open science.   I’ve noticed over the last few years that the scientific publication process (at lease in psychology, cognitive science, and neuroscience where I’ve been interested) is very slowly moving more in line with the ideals of open, transparent and reproducible research. I’m excited to get on board with this open science movement as much as possible early in my career - I’ve just submitted a final research paper to contribute towards my PhD, and I’ve chosen to submit it to a fully open access journal and make all of the related raw data, analysis scripts and paradigm code open source, so my results are reproducible. Hurrah!!! (I’m yet to submit a pre-registered report, but that’s next on my list of research goals). **So personally I am enthusiastic about open science.**


## Are early career researchers enthusiastic about open science? 
I would love to see some valid data addressing this question.  Anecdotal evidence from my conversations with friends/colleagues who are at similar career stage, and from my browsing of twitter and blogs, suggests that many early career researchers agree that open science is the way forward. When I’ve chatted about getting on board with the open science movement (e.g. **by signing [PRO] [2] , sharing data/analysis scripts, pre-registering studies etc.**), my colleagues have unanimously agree that it is a good idea and the best way forward for science, [for these reasons] [9] .


## So what’s stopping early career researchers practicing open science?
There may be many perceived barriers to implementing open science practises. For example, people have pointed out to me that currently the pressures and incentives set up in academic science, particularly for early career researchers, do not always encourage or reward the extra time taken to learn and implement open science practices.  One main points of concern I’ve heard seems to be a potential loss in the number of papers you can produce given the extra time taken to learn/implement open science practices. Since criteria for awards, post-doc positions, promotions, etc. tend to be heavily weighted on the of number of publications a researcher produces, and not necessarily on how ‘open’ the science is, by taking the extra time to implement open science practices one may risk a small decrease in number of papers produced.

**Is this a valid concern?** I cannot comment on changes (or lack of changes) in the weighting of open science practices as a criteria for awards, post-doc positions, promotions, etc. across research institutes. I can however comment on the perceived potential loss in the number of papers you can produce given the extra time taken to learn/implement open science practices:

**It definitely doesn’t actually take much extra time! HURRY!** There are many online tools to help with open science (e.g. the [OFS] [13] ). But it took me 4 weeks part-time (20 hours per week, so a total of 80 hours) back at the end of 2014/start of 2015 to learn how to use [R markdown] [10] and [github] [11] properly to share analysis and paradigm code. And this was coming from a point of complete ignorance about [R markdown] [10] and [github] [11]. There are many free online options to help learn such skills, for example I learned for free via these two courses [The Data Scientist’s Toolbox] [14] and [Reproducible Research] [15] .  And it took me about half an hour to work out that my university has an account with [figshare] [16] and then to upload my 24GB of raw data, and use [figshare’s neat “Generate private link” function] [17] for reviewers to access my data which can then be manually switched to public when you need it to be (i.e. once your paper is accepted for publication). 

So a total of ~80.5 hours of my time to gain the skills to make my analysis reproducible and share raw data. And now that I have these skills and enjoy implementing them as a usual part of my analysis pipeline, it will take me no extra time to make my data and analysis code open in the future. So regarding applying for awards, post-doc positions, etc. I’m banking on the hope that the reputational gain from doing fully open science from now on, is greater than a small one-off expenditure of ~80.5 hours that it took me to learn the necessary skills.  Furthermore, if I ever need to leave academia and [pursue work in industry] [18] then having programing, or at least scripting, skills for data analysis along with git/github for version control and reproducible research makes you more valuable for [data science/analytics jobs] [18] in industry, than only knowing how to analyse data with the old point-and-click style methods with software like SPSS etc. 

So from my viewpoint as a very early career researcher, no-matter how I look at it, it seems that open science is the way forward.

**Open science FTW!**
