Hello, I’m Daniel Newman, a PhD student in cognitive neuroscience at Monash University, Australia.

I completed my undergraduate and honours degree at University of Queensland in 2011, where my work exploring molecular genetic and electrophysiological correlates of visuospatial attention in humans was awarded the McElwain Prize for the best research thesis in Psychology.

I am now at Monash University Australia, as a member of the Bellgrove Laboratory. I am investigating the state (e.g. arousal/alertness, attentional load) and trait (e.g. genetics, hemispheric white matter asymmetries) factors that influence visuospatial attention asymmetries in healthy people and in people with disorders of attention (e.g. unilateral spatial neglect, ADHD). This involves the use of sensitive behavioural paradigms along with electroencephalography (EEG), pupillometry, molecular genetics, short wavelength light exposure, pharmacology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). My research will add to our understanding of the neural systems governing spatial attention in humans, and hopefully help to clarify precisely how these systems break down in disorders of spatial attention such as unilateral spatial neglect.

Since relocating to Monash I’ve also enjoyed conducting a few lectures in research methodology and statistics (PSY 2051) for the School of Psychology and Psychiatry, so I’ll be looking to do some more teaching at some point in the future.
